NewHacks 2019 IEEE Student Branch University of Toronto - March 23-24 

Created an app which is integrated with an arduino and photon wifi kit through a CRUD API with javascript to communicate whether or not a shelf is stocked
with the idea of helping retail workers/companies sell more products by keeping shelves stocked. 

Software used: Java & XML through Android Studio for the app
               Photon IDE for integrating the arduino and photon wifi kit
               Javascript for the server & web address that the app reads from and prints from
               
Hardware used: Photon wifi kit
               Arduino & related resistors and supplies
               Ultrasonic sensor to detect empty shelves

The github repo is arranged as 3 portions
  1. The javascript server folder
  2. The photon code hardware integration folder
  3. The app files (rest of the files aside from the above folders)
